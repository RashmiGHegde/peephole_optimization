Implementation of few concepts of Peephole Optimization

The Peephole Optimization is a kind of optimization technique performed over a very small set of instructions in a segment of generated assembly code [Intermediate code].

In this code,I have used EM stack machine language as input to process.

Algorithms used
Replace Sequence of Instruction with faster and/or fewer Instructions.

• Null Sequences

Null Sequence eliminates sequences or partial sequences of code that are redundant. ADI 0 is typically generated when accessing the ﬁrst ﬁeld of a record. The front end arranges for the address of the record to appear on the stack and then increases this address by the relative position of the desired ﬁeld in the record, which for the ﬁrst ﬁeld is 0.
